# Wordlist-Generator-Loweralpha-numeric
This Python program creates a word list and appends it to a file. This code is meant to create a dictionary for attack handshakes captured for WPA2 networks that are configured with a passkey that is loweralpha-numeric.

You can select the length of the passphrase and the amount of passwords to generate which comes a lot handy. the file will automatically be generated and is named "file.txt" in the current working directory that the file is running in.
